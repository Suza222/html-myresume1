    <p> Hey there! My name is Suzana. 


        If you're reading this, you've stumbled upon my latest adventure. Not too long ago, I was deep in the hustle and bustle of London, juggling roles as an account manager and project manager. My days were filled with meetings, deadlines, and the occasional sprint to catch the Tube. It was a world of spreadsheets, client calls, and making sure everything ran like clockwork.
        
        But amidst all that, a little voice kept nudging me towards a path I'd always been curious about but never ventured down: web development. Yes, after years of managing projects and accounts, I decided it was high time to swap my spreadsheets for code editors and dive into the world of web development headfirst.

    <p>So, here I am, embarking on this new journey. This website is my first foray into what I hope will be a fulfilling career shift. It's not just a career transition; it's me stepping out of my comfort zone and into the vast, ever-evolving digital universe.
        
        I won't sugarcoat itâ€”this is all pretty new to me, and I'm learning as I go. But that's the exciting part, right? Each line of code is a step further from my past life and deeper into this new digital domain I'm eager to master.

    <p>Thanks for dropping by and being part of this new chapter. Stick around, and let's see how this journey unfolds. Here's to new beginnings and the thrill of learning something completely different! </p>
